# kafka-shell

The goal was to get acquainted with Apache Kafka functionality.

connector_properties.txt contains all specified properties for the used connectors.
docker_containers.txt contains containers used for the task.
BD_Kafka_Viktor_Kim.docx contains step-by-step description of the whole process.

First part is about sending messages to a topic via stdin.

Second part is about pulling messages from a text file to 
a topic and then push to another text file.

Third pard is about connecting Kafka to MySQL and then consuming
data via stdout. Plus using Kafkadrop for monitoring.
